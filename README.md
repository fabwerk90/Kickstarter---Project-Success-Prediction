**Summary:**

In this project we aimed at finding a Machine-Learning model in order to predict whether a project on kickstarter can be successful or not. By applying different kinds of Classifying models we were able to determine the best models for this approach (namely: Random Forest, Gredient Descent Boost, Ada Boost and XGBoost).
In a last step we applied the stacking method in order to find the best predictions possible.


**Background information about Kickstarter:**

Kickstarter, founded in 2009, is one particularly well-known and popular crowdfunding platform. It has an all-or-nothing funding model, whereby a project is only funded if it meets its goal amount; otherwise no money is given by backers to a project. A huge variety of factors contribute to the success or failure of a project — in general, and also on Kickstarter. Some of these are able to be quantified or categorized, which allows for the construction of a model to attempt to predict whether a project will succeed or not. The aim of this project is to construct such a model and also to analyse Kickstarter project data more generally, in order to help potential project creators assess whether or not Kickstarter is a good funding option for them, and what their chances of success are.


**Business Case:**


**Structure of the repository:**

In this repository you find the whole process of our approach. To maintain a good overview, the notebooks are splitted in the following order:

Contents:
- 1. Data Mining and Cleaning
- 2. EDA: first insights
- 3. Feature Engineering
- 4. EDA: after feature engineering
- 5. Predictive Modeling
